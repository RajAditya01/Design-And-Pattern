# Design-And-Patterns
This repository provides examples and explanations of various design patterns. Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems in software development. By using design patterns, you can improve the structure, flexibility, and maintainability of your code.

Each design pattern is implemented in multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, and C++. The repository serves as a reference guide for understanding and applying design patterns in different contexts.

Pattern Categories
The design patterns in this repository are organized into the following categories:

Creational Patterns: These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, helping you create objects in a manner suitable for the situation. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, and Builder patterns.

Structural Patterns: These patterns deal with object composition and provide ways to form larger structures using classes and objects. Examples include Adapter, Decorator, and Proxy patterns.

Behavioral Patterns: These patterns focus on communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities. Examples include Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.
